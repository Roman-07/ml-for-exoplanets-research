# AI for Exoplanet Detection via Transit Photometry

## Overview

This repository contains my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ)
dissertation:

**"To what extent does AI assist in identifying exoplanets using the
transit photometry method?"**

The project explores how machine learning, particularly deep neural
networks, compares to traditional mathematical models in detecting
exoplanets from stellar light curves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Focus

The dissertation is structured around three core components:

-   Physics of **exoplanets** and the **transit photometry method**
-   Fundamentals of **machine learning**, including supervised learning
    and CNNs
-   Critical analysis of modern research comparing AI models with
    traditional algorithms such as BLS and TLS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Insights

-   Transit photometry is the most successful exoplanet detection
    method, with thousands of confirmed discoveries.
-   Traditional models (e.g., BLS, TLS) rely on curve fitting and
    statistical optimisation.
-   Deep learning models (especially CNNs) consistently achieve higher
    true positive rates and better ROC performance.
-   Recent research demonstrates significant gains in both **accuracy**
    and **computational speed** using GPU-accelerated AI systems.
-   AI is now a dominant tool in large-scale missions such as **Kepler**
    and **TESS**.
